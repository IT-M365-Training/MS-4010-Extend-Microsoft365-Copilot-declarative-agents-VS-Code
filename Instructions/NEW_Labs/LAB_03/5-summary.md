You want to improve the user experience when working with your declarative agent. Specifically, you want the agent to present the data that it receives from the API in a rich way.

You did some research and found that extending your agent with using Adaptive Cards to render information is suitable for your needs, because:

- It allows you to build on your existing work.
- It gives you control over how the agent presents the data.
- It allows you to present the data in a visually appealing way.
- It allows you to include information beyond the few basic semantic properties that the agent supports.

Previously, when exploring the menu, you had to rely on the textual description of the dish.

By using Adaptive Cards, you can include images, text, and buttons to make the information more engaging. You can also render the order summary using an Adaptive Card to provide a visual representation of the order.
