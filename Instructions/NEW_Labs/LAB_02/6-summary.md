You're looking into building a solution for your organization that allows you to order food from a local restaurant. The solution must use natural language and integrate with Microsoft 365 Copilot.

You did some research and found that building a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot, integrated with an API plugin is suitable for your needs, because:

- It allows you to build an AI-powered assistant that understands natural language.
- It allows you to build on top of the infrastructure of Microsoft 365 Copilot.
- It allows you to use instructions to optimize the assistant to your scenario.
- It allows you to connect the agent to the restaurant's API to browse their menu and place orders.

Previously, you and your colleagues had to spend valuable time on the phone to learn about today's menu and place an order that meets everyone's dietary needs.

By building a declarative agent, you and your colleagues can quickly find out today's menu and filter it according to their preferences. Having the agent available in Microsoft 365 Copilot is convenient because it's available at your fingertips where you already are without having to navigate to a separate application.
