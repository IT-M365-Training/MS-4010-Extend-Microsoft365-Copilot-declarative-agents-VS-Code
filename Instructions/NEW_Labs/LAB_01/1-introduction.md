---

# Introduction

Use declarative agents to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot. You define custom knowledge to create agents that can answer questions using authoritative content.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work in a customer support team. You and your team handle queries about products that your organization makes from customers. You want to improve response times and provide a better experience. You store documents in a document library on a SharePoint Online site that contains product specifications, frequently asked questions, and policies for handling repairs, returns, and warranties. You want to be able to use natural language to query information in these documents and get answers quickly to customer queries.

## What will we be doing?

Here, you create a declarative agent which can answer product support questions using information stored in documents in Microsoft 365:

- **Create**: Create a declarative agent project and use Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code.
- **Custom instructions**: Shape responses by defining custom instructions.
- **Custom grounding**: Add extra context to the agent by configuring grounding data.
- **Conversation starters**: Define prompts for starting new conversations.
- **Provision**: Upload your declarative agent to Microsoft 365 Copilot and validate the results.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of what Microsoft 365 Copilot is and how it works
- Basic knowledge of what a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot is
- Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft 365 Copilot
- Account with rights to upload custom apps to Microsoft Teams
- Access to a Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft 365 Copilot
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) extension installed
- [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

## Lab Duration

- **Estimated Time to complete**: 30 minutes

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you're able to create a declarative agent, upload it to Microsoft 365, then use it in Microsoft 365 Copilot to validate the results.
