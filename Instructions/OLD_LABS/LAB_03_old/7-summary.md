# Summary

Using Microsoft Graph connectors, you can centralize information in your organization on Microsoft 365. Importing external content to Microsoft 365 allows you to find and discover relevant information and share it with your colleagues more easily. When you use Copilot for Microsoft 365, importing external content to Microsoft 365 lets Copilot reason over all information in your organization, which empowers it to give you more relevant responses.

You can build Microsoft Graph connectors on any platform and technology stack using Microsoft Graph APIs.
