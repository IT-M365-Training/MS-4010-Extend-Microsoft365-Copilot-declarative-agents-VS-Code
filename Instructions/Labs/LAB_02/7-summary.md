    module: 'LAB 02: Build your own message extension plugin with TypeScript (TS) for Microsoft Copilot'
---

# Summary

In this module, you prepared your development environment for developing message extension plugins for Microsoft Copilot. This includes setting up a Microsoft 365 account with the necessary permissions and licenses, installing Visual Studio Code, NodeJS, Azure Storage Explorer, and the Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code. You also learned how to clone or download a sample repository from GitHub and copy the sample documents to your OneDrive.

During the exercises, you ran an application as a plugin for Teams and Outlook, using the Northwind database stored in Azure Table Storage. You built the application using a connection string, ran it locally using Visual Studio Code, and tested it in Teams and Outlook. Additionally, you enhanced the Teams Message Extension and Copilot plugin by adding a new command to provide information related to Northwindâ€™s customers.

By acquiring these new skills, you're now able to extend Copilot in your organization. This allows you to develop message extension plugins, integrate with Microsoft 365 applications, and handle messages and adaptive card actions. This will have a positive impact on your business by enabling you to create custom functionality and enhance productivity within the Copilot platform.
